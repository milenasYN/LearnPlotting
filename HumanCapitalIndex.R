# Data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and other advanced technologies are reshaping the world.
# # We're starting to see glimpses of it, for example the rapid emergence of self driving cars. Moreover, 
# the changes brought about by technology will likely become more frequent and more dramatic in the next few years.
# 
# In fact, two MIT economist, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, think that the emergence of AI and data 
# driven technologies may be one of the most important events in all of human history. 
# 
# Risk and opportunity in the age of AI
# 
# They suggest that AI and automation will dramatically increase productivity and human development. 
# In essence, AI, machine learning, and data-driven technology will free us from our cognitive limitations 
# much like the engine freed us from our physical limitations. This will in turn lead to large gains 
# in productivity.
# 
# But while AI and data-driven tech will likely increase productivity, they are also likely to lead to 
# high levels of unemployment. As software and technology become more intelligent, they will replace people 
# who don't have the right skills.
# 
# A critical factor for success: human capital
# 
# How can someone succeed in such an era?
# 
# Brynjolfsson and McAfee point out that one of the keys to success in the age of data, AI, and automation will be human capital.
# 
# As technology increasingly substitutes for people, one of the keys to success will be cutting-edge knowledge, 
# judgement (particularly in complex domains), and creativity.
# 
# Mapping Human Capital
# 
# In thinking about this, I decided to map which countries have the highest levels of human capital, 
# as measured by the World Economic Forum.
# 
# While the WEF's Human Capital Index is not a perfect index of cutting edge skill, it does provide a high-level 
# view of the countries that may be better prepared for a changing, high-tech world.
# 
# One thing in particular that I'll note, is that this map effectively shows averages of national performance. 
# Having said that, talent and innovation are known to be highly uneven geographically. There are "spikes." 
# So even though this map shows countries' average performance, we'd likely see an even different story 
# if we looked at cities (or even zip codes).
